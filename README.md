# Experiments with QT framework and nissy

This repository contains some experiments with [QT](https://www.qt.io)
in an attempt to make a usable UI for [nissy](https://nissy.tronto.net).

These experiments are not fully-featured and I may not develop further in
this direction.

If you want to try them out, the most usable one is in the `qt-quick` folder.
